#MINI-CIRCUITS ZSDR-230 Testing

= Introduction =

I bought 6 of these MINI-CIRCUITS ZSDR-230 switches on Ebay for $80US.
They are 5vdc, and use TTL to drive the switch between COM and RF1/RF2.
In testing with Hermes this evening I discovered @ 50Mhz it's quite excellent!

= Details =

  * At -33dbm injected on COM (not calibrated, Elecraft XG3 used) I saw -37.6dbm at RF2.
  * At -33dbm injected on RF1 I saw -102.5dbm on RF2 at all times.
  * -102.5dbm - -37.6dbm = *-64.9dbm isolation* between RF1 & RF2.
