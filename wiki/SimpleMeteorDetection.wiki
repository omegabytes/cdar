#Meteor Detection using inexpensive RTL TV Dongles

= Introduction =

For a few years now I've been using these cheap RTL (R820T, FC0013) TV dongles (about $15-20USD) as inexpensive SDR receivers.  I've been wanting to get one of them working as a Meteor Detector (and counter) for a while now.  This is how I accomplished it.


= Details =

Things you'll need:
  * A RTL Dongle (I prefer the Nooelec R820T) but likely any will be ok.
  * Antenna (a directional antenna will be useful, but anything will work) I use a 6 Ele 50Mhz Yagi at 15 feet up.
  * Coax (better is gooderer :-)  I already had LMR400 on this antenna.
  * Not required, but I use a Miteq LNA 'AU-2A-0110' and sometimes a Miteq 'AU-1362'
  * SOFTWARE:
    * SDR#
    * Zadig.exe
    * Spectrum Lab
      * script for spectrum lab to do the automated detection process.
    * Colorgramme
