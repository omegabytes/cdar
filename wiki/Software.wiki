#Wish list of Software for this project

= Introduction =

This will serve as a general 'wish-list' of software items for this project.


= Details =

== Settings ==
  * monostatic mode / bistatic mode / bistatic reception station mode
  * varying the audio frequency ramp
  * varying the bandwidth of the chirp from 3Khz up to 100Khz
  * varying the timing of the chirp from 1ms to 30ms
  * varying the timing of the TR relay (if known or desired timing, will be overridden by J3 status)
  * varying the timing of the RX period from 1ms tp 300ms
  * checking the condition of a user defined J16 pin for TX-INHIBIT (both J3 status voltages from the TR)
    * this may require FPGA code changes, or may just be something we need to check the status of if it already exists in the current FPGA code (it may just be a status check)
  * Ability to test (at low output power) the status of J3's so that we can determine the fastest TR speeds achievable)

== Abilities ==
  * Support for LSB, USB, CW 
  * Large Status "Lamp/Button" (Gray when OFF, Green in RX mode, Red in TX mode)
    * Clicking this button will stop all activity (used as a panic button, in case something goes wrong)
  * Display Modes
    * FFTW water fall Mode
    * Panadapter Display Mode
    * Panafall Display Mode
  * Other abilities
    * ability to CWID
    * ability to beacon
    * ability to determine exact lat/long via GPSDO device
    * ability to display results in km and miles
    * ability to display green-heron Azimuth and status
    * ability to relay data gathered back to a central web-service

== Web Service ==

  * api to accept relayed data from clients
  * ability to display results gathered on real-time web page for all to see
  * api should require as input from the client (for each data set sent) as a minimum:
    * callsign
    * lat/long
    * UTC timestamp (of the data report being made by the client)
    * 'echo report' data from the client software
  * Mapping 
    * Echo data (showing hot-spots 'backscatter zones)
    * Locations of all stations (CDAR Chirp Transmitter(s), Echo Reception Stations)
      * callsign
      * lat/long and Maidenhead Grid
      * last report received UTC timestamp
