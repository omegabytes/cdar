#NW0W BUILD of the VK3OE Designed TR PIN SWITCH

= Introduction =

Step-By-Step Detail on NW0W Build of the VK3OE TR PIN Switch.


= Construction Detail =

Steps Taken To recreate the Design VK3OE modeled that is based on a hybrid of a 50kw NOAA T/R Switch and one built by SM5BSZ.
  * Purchased items in Table 1 of *...*
  * Building the Coils
    * To wind the required 10mm diameter coils requires 14 AWG Magnet wire, which is wound around a 9mm form.  In my case I choose to use the shank of an old 23/64 Drill Bit which is very close to 9mm diameter.  This size plus the 14 AWG gauge wire creates the 10mm diameter coil requirement.
      * A photo of the drill bit used is here.  I wrapped one layer of electrical tape around the shank of the drill-bit in order to not scratch the coating of the magnet wire in the coil area as I wound them.
      * Winding the coils is pretty straight forward, you simply wrap the wire around the drill-bit or 9mm form the number of turns required by the schematic.
    * Final product of the coils should look something like this.
