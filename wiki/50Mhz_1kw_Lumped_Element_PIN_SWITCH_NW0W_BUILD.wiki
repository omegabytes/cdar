Step-By-Step Detail on NW0W Build of the VK3OE TR PIN Switch.


= Construction Detail =

Steps Taken To recreate the Design [https://cdar.googlecode.com/files/50Mhz_1kw_PIN_SWITCH.png VK3OE modeled] that is based on a hybrid of a 50kw NOAA T/R Switch and one built by SM5BSZ.
  * Purchased items in Table 1 of *...*
  * *Building the Coils*
    * To wind the required 10mm diameter coils requires 14 AWG Magnet wire, which is wound around a 9mm form.  In my case I choose to use the shank of an old 23/64 Drill Bit which is very close to 9mm diameter.  This size plus the 14 AWG gauge wire creates the 10mm diameter coil requirement.
      * A photo of [http://cdar.googlecode.com/files/23_64_9mm_drillbit.jpg the drill bit used is here].  I wrapped one layer of electrical tape around the shank of the drill-bit in order to not scratch the coating of the magnet wire in the coil area as I wound them.
      * Winding the coils is pretty straight forward, you simply wrap the wire around the drill-bit or 9mm form the number of turns required by the schematic.
    * Final product of the coils should look something like this.

  * I'm currently held up waiting for a slow Ebayer to mail my FR4 copper clad PCB's.  However as of 2013-03-04 I got notice that his back orders are starting to ship.  (tried to save a few bucks here, and it bit me in the ass this time).  Anyway, I should be back on the build of this board very soon.
