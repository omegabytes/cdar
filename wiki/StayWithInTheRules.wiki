#In the USA we have to follow the *FCC* rules in part 97.

= Introduction =

  * We need to stay within the [http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Regulatory/Part%2097%20-%2004-28-2011.pdf FCC Part 97 Rules.]
  * We need to stay within the [http://www.arrl.org/band-plan ARRL Establish Band-Plan.]

= Details =

  === FCC Part 97.203, "CDAR" is NOT a beacon! ===
     * "CDAR" will be 'attended operation' ONLY.
     * "CDAR" will operate above 100w.
     * "CDAR" will operate between 50.6 - 50.8 Mhz (nonvoice communications - see ARRL band plan)
{{{
* "CDAR" will periodically CQ DE <CALLSIGN> QSX <FREQ> 
  * Similar to those calling "VVV CQ <CALL>"
    * The exception is that we will
      * "Chirp" 1 second (500hz-2500hz sweep over 1 second period)
      * listen 1 second (record echos)
      * repeat above for a time
      * Periodically ID every few minutes with the preamble
        * CQ DE <CALLSIGN> QSX <FREQ>
        * ANSWER CALLERS.
      * LOG Echo Results - Automatically & Publish the results.
      * LOG QSOs - Automatically & Publish the results.
}}}
  

  === ARRL 6m (50 Mhz) Band Plan ===
    * For this type of operation we want to operate well outside the most commonly used freq-ranges to mitigate any interference.
    * Possible Ranges of operation appear to be
      * 50.3 - 50.6 Mhz "All modes" (but commonly AM)
      * *50.6 - 50.8 Mhz* "Nonvoice communication" *** (likely best candidate)
