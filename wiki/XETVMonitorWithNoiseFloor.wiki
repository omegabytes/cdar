Using Spectrumlab I am able to capture my IF out via LP-Pan to a E-Mu 1010m ADAT card.  The IQ is then monitored as a 192khz Spectrum at 9Mhz.

With a little patience I was able to find where 55.240, 55.250, and 55.260 are in the spectrum being monitored.

Then I setup discrete 'channels' for the "SL Watch List and Plotter" to monitor.

Each channel displays Avg, Max, and Min so you see a nice range for each time moment being plotted per channel.
