#50Mhz 1kw Lumped-Element PIN Switch

= Introduction =

Monostatic Radar requires very high speed  TR (transmit/receive) switching.  The TR switch must have very high isolation between T and R components.  It must also have very LOW insertion loss.  Although the design we've settled on suites our requirements for this project, it is likely useful for MANY OTHER applications within the Amateur domain.

This design is a bit of a hybrid between an old TR Radar Switch from NOAA, and a newer version from SM5BSZ.  It was modeled by VK3OE (Andrew Martin).

= Details =

*THIS IS THE CRUX OF MAKING Monostatic Radar WORK* We need a RF switch that has:

  * 1 COMM Port (antenna)
  * 2 Ports (TX and RX)
  * Can switch in <= .5mS
  * Can Handle 500W Average (1 sec ON @500W, 1 sec OFF)
  * Can Handle Billions of cycles *(this eliminates virtually all NON-PIN Diode switches 1yr = 31.5M sec)*
  * Can be easily reproduced by other Hams and used for other projects as well.

= Expectations of the switch we've choosen =

  * KEYUP time 500ns (nano-seconds)
  * KEYDOWN time 1.5us (micro-seconds)
  * Easily able to support 1kw
  * *these are WELL WITHIN the requirements we set out to have!*
