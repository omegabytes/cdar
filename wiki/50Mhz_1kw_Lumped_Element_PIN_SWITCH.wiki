#50Mhz 1kw Lumped-Element PIN Switch

= Introduction =

Monostatic Radar requires very high speed  TR (transmit/receive) switching.  The TR switch must have very high isolation between T and R components.  It must also have very LOW insertion loss.  Although the design we've settled on suites our requirements for this project, it is likely useful for MANY OTHER applications within the Amateur domain.

This design is a bit of a hybrid between an old TR Radar Switch from NOAA, and a newer version from SM5BSZ.  It was modeled by VK3OE (Andrew Martin).
