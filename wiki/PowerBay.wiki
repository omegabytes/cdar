= Introduction =

This 19" Rack will include ALL power sources.  It has already been purchased, however we may need to have two of them before it's all said and done.

The +50vdc Meanwell supply, and the +-15vdc HP supply are fairly large, and may require a single enclosure just for them.

While the +28vdc, +12vdc, and +5vdc are fairly small.

= Details =

This enclosure will include:
  * +50vdc @32A, 220vac to power the 900w Pallet amp.
  * +28vdc @1A, 120vac to power the small Booster amp.
  * +-15vdc @3A, 120vac to power the High Power TR PIN Switch.
  * +12vdc @8A, 120vac for Hermes and other items.
  * +5vdc @1A, DCDC converter for Hermes and other items (TTL and such)
