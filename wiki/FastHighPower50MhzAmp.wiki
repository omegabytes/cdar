= Introduction =

SSHP 50Mhz Amp with VERY FAST T/R Switching (for pulsing)

= Status =

  * 2013-04-19 Most of the other equipment is now purchased, and built.  The Amp is the last of the big dollar items (although the price is very reasonable)!  I intend to order and build/install the amp the first weeks in May.

= Details =

The amp we're going to use is a 900w (capable) with 2.2w INPUT, likely running only about 200-300w for this project normally.

Mounted on a [http://www.broadcastconcepts.com/Pallet-Amp-HeatSinks/13.5%22%20Bonded%20Heat%20Sink 13.5" Heatsink].

I already have an [http://www.w6pql.com/amplifier_control_board.htm amp control board] as well as a [http://www.w6pql.com/Sampling_RF_Power.htm Dual RF Sampler] for amp protection.

This will be mounted in a 19" x 10" Hammond Rack Mountable Enclosure.  

The PA Power Supply is small enough to fit in the "PowerBay" we already have, and installation of other system related PS's was done in order to accomodate [http://www.broadcastconcepts.com/DC-Power-Supplies-Pallet-Amps/MeanWell%201500W%2048V%20DC%20Power%20Supply this] 50v @ 32A supply.

Apache-Labs "Hermes" power output appears to be around 380-400mW.  This should be adequate to drive this PA up to about 200+ Watts, which is on target with what we wanted to start with.

At some point in the future we may add a small 'booster' amp to be able to drive the PA up to full rated (safe) power out.
