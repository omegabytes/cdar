Open a command prompt

ctrl-c (control C) exits the test.

If you see an continous 'lost at least' message hit CTRL and C to cancel and try the next level below:

  * 3.2msps
    * C:\Program Files\RTL_SDR>rtl_test -s 3.2e6
  * 2.88msps
    * C:\Program Files\RTL_SDR>rtl_test -s 2.88e6
  * 2.4msps (_this is the one I am now using because the previous two show lost data packets, and you don't want that_)
    *C:\Program Files\RTL_SDR>rtl_test -s 2.4e6

This will tell you if your loosing any data when running at higher speed sampling rates.
